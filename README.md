GenOffice is a free, open-source alternative to Microsoft Office for macOS,
Windows and Linux. It opens and saves native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx`
files, edits PDF, Markdown and HTML, and puts an AI agent next to every
document — not a chat box bolted on the side, but an editor that reads the
file, makes the change, and shows you exactly what it touched.

- **Real formats, byte-preserving.** Only what you edit is rewritten. Everything
  else in the file survives byte-for-byte, so documents keep working in Word,
  Excel and PowerPoint.
- **AI you can review.** Edits land as tracked changes and diffs with one-click
  rollback. Spreadsheets get live formulas, not pasted numbers. Decks and pages
  are generated onto the canvas and stay fully editable.
- **Local by design.** Files open, edit, save and convert on your machine.
  PDF → Word / Excel / PowerPoint, Markdown → Word and HTML → Word all run
  on-device. Only the AI calls leave the machine, to the provider you choose.
- **Find files by what they say.** The home screen searches the names,
  folders and full text of your `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, PDF, Markdown and
  HTML files from a local SQLite index, CJK included. Optionally, the top hits
  are reranked by **[TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai/)**, the System One
  judgment model, so the file that answers your question comes first.
- **Your keys or none.** Sign in with Genspark and skip keys, or bring your own
  key for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax,
  Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty, Opper, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, local
  servers included.
- **Scriptable and agent-ready.** The app ships a `genoffice` command line and
  a skill for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode
  and Windsurf, so a coding agent can create, convert, read and edit real
  Office files on your machine without opening a window.

**Get it:** [macOS](https://github.com/genspark-ai/genoffice/releases/latest) (Apple Silicon and Intel) ·

## Demo

Six apps, one AI panel, a file search reranked by TypeSafe Jev, and a
command line for your coding agent. Every
screenshot is the real app on macOS, with the AI driven from the prompt you
can read in the panel.

### 1 · Docs — open and edit `.docx` with an AI you can review

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/docs-report.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs rendering a two-column annual-report page with a full-width cover image, shaded KPI table, header and footer, at 80% zoom with the AI panel collapsed"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/docs-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs: a company overview with a banner image; the AI tightened the Overview and inserted a new bulleted section, and the panel offers a one-click roll back"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Opens the file as Word lays it out</b> — two-column sections, full-bleed images, shaded tables, headers and footers, pagination on Word's line metrics. Styles, comments, tracked changes, equations and ink round-trip untouched.</td>
<td><b>Ask for the edit</b> — the AI reads the blocks it needs, rewrites the Overview and inserts a new bulleted section. Every AI turn is a snapshot you can roll back; with <b>Track changes</b> on, edits arrive as Word-style revisions.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 2 · Sheets — `.xlsx` with live formulas and charts, not pasted numbers

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/sheets-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Sheets: the AI added a Summary sheet with revenue by region and category using SUMIF formulas, plus a column chart, and reports 43 applied changes with an Undo button"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/sheets-qa.webp" alt="GenOffice Sheets: asked which region led Q2 revenue, the AI answers Europe with the category breakdown and cites the cells it used as links, next to the Orders sheet"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Build it</b> — from one sentence the agent adds a Summary sheet with real <code>SUMIF</code>s by region and category, inserts a column chart, and applies the 43 changes as a single undoable batch.</td>
<td><b>Ask it</b> — questions about the workbook come back with the reasoning and the exact cells used as clickable citations. Under the hood: an in-house Rust <code>.xlsx</code> engine, pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting and formula tracing.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 3 · Slides — from a prompt to a `.pptx` deck

<img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-generate.webp" alt="Time-lapse of GenOffice Slides generating the Aurora Home investor deck: the AI plans the storyline in the panel, slides appear on the canvas one after another, and the finished deck ends on the closing ask" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-cover.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides: the cover slide of an AI-generated Aurora Home investor deck on the canvas, with the original one-line prompt and the AI's summary of what it built in the panel"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides: the designed closing slide of the same 11-slide deck, with the thumbnail strip on the left and the AI panel summarizing the storyline"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>One line in</b> — "Create a 10-slide investor pitch deck for Aurora Home…". GenOffice plans the storyline, researches the numbers, and drafts every slide onto the canvas as a real <code>.pptx</code>.</td>
<td><b>A finished deck out</b> — eleven designed slides with consistent typography, imagery and a closing call to action; keep editing with masters, layouts, smart guides and non-destructive cropping, or ask the panel to restyle, rewrite and reorder.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 4 · PDF — edit PDF text in place, convert PDF to Word on-device

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/pdf-edit.webp" alt="GenOffice PDF: Edit text mode outlines every text block on the page for in-place editing while the AI panel answers a question about the report with page citations"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/pdf-convert.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs showing a Word document converted locally from the Helios quarterly review PDF, opened in a second tab beside the original PDF"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Edit inside the page</b> — Edit text mode outlines every text block for in-place retyping; the content stream is rewritten through PDFium with the original fonts, not a cover-up annotation. Ask the AI about a long report and get answers with page citations.</td>
<td><b>Convert on-device</b> — <b>PDF Converter → PDF to Word</b> produces an editable <code>.docx</code> that opens in Docs next to the source, headings, stat rows and paragraphs intact. Excel and PowerPoint targets work the same way; scanned pages go through the system OCR.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 5 · HTML — an AI page and UI builder, design brief first

Say what the page is for and who it is for. The AI proposes a **design brief**
first — hook, palette, typography and style directions — then builds a single
self-contained `.html` file against those tokens.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/html-restyle-motion.webp" alt="Time-lapse of GenOffice HTML restyling the Lumen landing page: one Restyle request in the panel turns the dark Midnight Studio page into the warm Solar Daybreak version while every section and all copy stay in place" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated landing page for a solar desk lamp in the dark Midnight Studio direction, shown in the live preview with the AI panel summarizing the page it just built"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-restyle.webp" alt="The same Lumen landing page restyled by the AI into the warm Solar Daybreak direction: paper background, serif headlines and an orange accent, with every section and all copy kept"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Generated from one prompt</b> — a bold hero, feature cards, pricing and a waitlist form for Lumen, built in the Midnight Studio direction. Click any element to restyle it, double-click to edit text, or switch to the CodeMirror source view.</td>
<td><b>Same design, new direction</b> — one <b>Restyle</b> request swaps the brief's tokens and the page follows: warm paper, editorial serif, sun-orange accent, nothing rewritten. Present fullscreen, or export as PDF or a native editable Word document.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-dashboard.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated personal dashboard UI for a freelance designer in a warm linen style, with a left rail, serif greeting and four metric cards"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-report.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated EV-market data report in a broadsheet style, with a serif masthead, a 17.3 million headline figure and a stat row"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>UI mockups</b> — the "personal dashboard" starter turns a persona into a working layout: left rail, greeting, billable-hours sparkline, invoice and utilization cards, all real HTML you can hand to a developer.</td>
<td><b>Data stories</b> — the "data report" starter builds an editorial broadsheet: serif masthead, one headline number, a rule-separated stat row, inline SVG charts and a methodology note.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 6 · Markdown — a block editor over plain `.md`, with Ask AI

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/markdown-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Markdown: a selected paragraph shows an Ask AI popover with a typed instruction and suggestion chips such as Polish, Make more concise, Expand and Fix grammar, plus Send now and Add to queue buttons"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/markdown-render.webp" alt="GenOffice Markdown rendering a launch-notes document with a table, a Mermaid flowchart and a task list, with the AI panel's starter prompts on the left"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Ask AI about a selection</b> — select any passage and an <b>Ask AI</b> chip appears: type an instruction or pick a suggestion, send it now, or queue several anchored edits and run them in one pass. The same entry exists in every app.</td>
<td><b>Rendered, saved as plain Markdown</b> — headings, lists, tables, images, code blocks and Mermaid diagrams in a Tiptap block editor, written back as plain <code>.md</code>, with a fully local <b>Markdown → Word</b> export.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 7 · Search — find the file that answers the question, with TypeSafe Jev

Every file in your work folder is indexed on-device: names, folders and the
extracted text of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Markdown and HTML files, in a
SQLite full-text index with CJK-aware tokenizing. Switch on **Jev search
reranking** and the top 20 local hits are judged by
[TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev),
the System One model that returns one calibrated relevance score per document
in a single call instead of generating text. The list is reordered by
that score; if the call fails or times out, the local order stays.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/search-jev-motion.webp" alt="Screen recording of the GenOffice home screen: typing laptop refresh policy lists a browser-cache policy, a brand-refresh plan and a dashboard-refresh schedule first while the equipment standards document is last; the Settings page shows Jev search reranking switched on under AI Media & Search with the TypeSafe endpoint; the same search then shows the equipment standards document first with a Jev badge next to the result count" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/search-jev-before-after.webp" alt="Two result lists for the query laptop refresh policy side by side: without Jev the dashboard refresh schedule, brand refresh plan and browser cache refresh policy lead and the company equipment standards document is fifth; with Jev the equipment standards document, which states the three-year laptop replacement cycle, is first"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/search-jev-settings.webp" alt="GenOffice Settings, AI Media & Search page: the Local file search block with the Jev search reranking switch, the endpoint choice between OpenRouter and TypeSafe, and the API key field"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Same words, different answers</b> — "laptop refresh policy" matches a browser-cache refresh policy, a brand-refresh plan and a dashboard-refresh schedule word for word, so full-text ranking puts them first. Jev reads the excerpts and moves the equipment standards document, the one that states the three-year replacement cycle, to the top. The <b>Jev</b> badge next to the result count shows when the order came from the model.</td>
<td><b>Off by default, one switch to turn on</b> — Settings → AI Media & Search → Local file search. Pick OpenRouter or TypeSafe direct, paste a key, hit Test connection. Only when the switch is on do excerpts of the top hits leave the device; the index itself never does.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 8 · CLI — your coding agent drives GenOffice, on your machine

GenOffice ships a `genoffice` command line and an agent skill. Install the
skill and Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode or
Windsurf can create, convert, read and edit real Office files through the
same engines as the apps, without opening a window.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-deck-in-app.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides showing an eight-slide Solar System deck that a coding agent built through the genoffice command line: the cover slide on the canvas, eight thumbnails on the left and the AI panel open" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-slides-grid.webp" alt="The eight rendered slides of the Solar System deck side by side: cover, exploration timeline, four key numbers, planet-diameter bar chart, rocky worlds versus giants, the Sun's 99.8% hero number, the four giants grid and takeaways"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-integrations.webp" alt="GenOffice Settings, Integrations page: the genoffice skill installed into Claude Code, with Install buttons next to Codex and Cursor"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>One prompt to your agent</b> — "Build an eight-slide deck about the Solar System." The agent reads the skill, writes a style sheet, an outline and one page spec per slide, generates the two photos with <code>genoffice image</code>, and lets <code>genoffice slides check</code> reject anything that overflows or overlaps before <code>genoffice create</code> assembles the <code>.pptx</code> and <code>slides render</code> hands back a PNG per slide to look at.</td>
<td><b>Install once, from Settings → Integrations</b> — GenOffice lists the coding agents it finds on this computer and writes the skill into each one you pick. Or download the skill as a zip, or run <code>npx skills add genspark-ai/genoffice</code>. Commands and the full workflow are in <a href="#command-line-and-agent-skill">Command line and agent skill</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 9 · MCP — the same tools over the Model Context Protocol

Every `genoffice` command is also an MCP tool. Claude Code, Claude Desktop,
Cursor and any other MCP client can start `genoffice mcp` themselves, with no
skill to install and no window open, and get 29 tools plus the op references
as resources. A second, HTTP server inside the app lets an agent build a Word
document in a visible editor tab while you watch.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/mcp-deck-motion.webp" alt="Time-lapse of Claude Code building an eight-slide renewable-energy investor briefing through the genoffice MCP server: it searches for figures and photos, checks each candidate picture with media, deck_start writes the style sheet and outline, deck_page adds one checked page at a time, deck_build assembles the .pptx and slides_render returns a picture of every slide; the finished deck then opens in GenOffice Slides" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/mcp-deck-in-app.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides showing the eight-slide Renewable Energy 2026 deck that Claude Code built through the genoffice MCP server: the cover slide with a wind-farm photograph on the canvas and eight thumbnails on the left"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/mcp-integrations.webp" alt="GenOffice Settings, Integrations page, MCP part: the one-line claude mcp add command for Claude Code, the JSON block for Cursor, Claude Desktop and other MCP clients, and the local HTTP server option below"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>One prompt, 38 tool calls, no shell</b> — "Build an eight-slide investor briefing about renewable energy in 2026, with a real photo on the cover and wherever a photo helps." The agent pulls the figures and the photos with <code>search</code>, asks <code>media</code> whether each candidate picture is a real photograph, calls <code>deck_start</code> with a style sheet and an outline, then <code>deck_page</code> once per slide; every page is checked against the outline and the palette before it is kept, <code>deck_build</code> assembles the <code>.pptx</code>, <code>slides_audit</code> looks for overflow, <code>slides_render</code> hands back a PNG per slide as image content the model can look at, and <code>deck_replace</code> fixes the three pages it did not like.</td>
<td><b>Connect once, from Settings → Integrations</b> — copy the <code>claude mcp add</code> line for Claude Code, or the JSON block into Cursor, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client. Option B switches on the local HTTP server for the visible Word editor. Both are described in <a href="#mcp-server">MCP server</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Why GenOffice

- **Open source**, Apache-2.0, built in the open on GitHub.
- **Yours to run.** Native apps for macOS, Windows and Linux; files stay on your
  disk and every edit, save and conversion happens on your machine.
- **Real Office files.** Native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx`, byte-preserving:
  the parts of a file you did not touch are copied exactly as they were.
- **An AI that edits the document itself.** Tracked changes in Docs, live
  formulas and charts in Sheets, slides drawn onto the canvas, every AI turn a
  snapshot you can roll back.
- **Your model, your key.** Sign in with Genspark, or bring a key for Claude,
  OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek and more, local servers and any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint included.
- **PDF done properly.** Edit text inside the page, and convert PDF to Word,
  Excel or PowerPoint on-device, with system OCR for scans.
- **Markdown and HTML too**, with the same AI panel and local export to Word.
- **Search that finds the answer, not the keyword.** Full-text search over
  every document in your folders, indexed on-device, with optional reranking
  by TypeSafe Jev, the System One judgment model.
- **Scriptable.** A `genoffice` command line, an agent skill and an MCP server
  put every engine at the service of Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor
  and other agents, still on-device.
- **Free**, for individuals and teams alike.

## AI backends

**Sign in with Genspark** and there is nothing to configure: model calls route
through the Genspark proxy (Claude, GPT and Gemini families) and the agents get
web and image search, image generation, and image/audio/video analysis.

**Or bring your own key.** Settings → AI lists Claude, OpenAI, Gemini,
DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty, Opper
and OpenCode Zen/Go, plus a custom slot for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (base
URL + key), including local model servers. Search and media have their own
per-capability providers under **AI Media & Search**: Serper, Serply, Tavily or Parallel for
web search, and OpenAI, Gemini, Doubao/Seedream, GLM, Grok, Qwen, MiniMax or any
OpenAI-compatible images endpoint for image generation and image/video
analysis, plus DeepSeek V4.1 Flash for image analysis.

**TypeSafe Jev** reranks the home screen's file search. Under **AI Media & Search →
Local file search**, switch on Jev search reranking and pick an endpoint:
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe) (model `typesafe/jev-1.13`) or
TypeSafe's own API. The key is stored only on this device. It is off by
default; when on, the excerpts of the top 20 local hits are sent for judgment
and nothing else leaves the machine.

**Parallel** works without an account: its free Search MCP (rate-limited) is the
default web search whenever no Genspark login or search key is configured, and
it runs ahead of the DuckDuckGo scrape. Select Parallel under Web search and
enter a [Parallel](https://platform.parallel.ai/) key to use the Search API
instead.

The whole suite ships light, dark and system themes. Themes only change what
is on screen: exports, prints and saved files always keep the document's own
colors.

## Command line and agent skill

Everything the apps can do to a file, the `genoffice` command line can do from
a terminal: inspect, convert, create, read and edit Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
PDF, Markdown and HTML on the same engines, headless. It installs with
GenOffice, needs no runtime of its own, and never sends a document anywhere.
Paired with the bundled **agent skill**, it turns a coding agent into a
document worker that produces real Office files instead of Markdown
approximations.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot,
OpenCode and Windsurf out of the box, any other agent that reads skills, and,
through the [MCP server](#mcp-server), Claude Desktop and every MCP client.

### Install the skill

| How                                    | What happens                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Settings → Integrations** in the app | Lists the agents found on this computer; one click writes the skill into each one you choose. An **Update** button appears when a GenOffice release ships a newer skill. |
| **Download as zip** on the same page   | The layout claude.ai, the Claude desktop apps and other assistants accept as an uploaded skill.                                                                          |
| `npx skills add genspark-ai/genoffice` | Installs from this repository into any skills-compatible agent.                                                                                                          |

Then start a new chat and ask for a document. The skill teaches the agent when
to reach for `genoffice`, how to read a file before editing it, and how to
check its own work.

### Quickstart from the terminal

```bash
genoffice --version
genoffice info report.docx --json                  # headings and blocks; or sheets, slides, pages
genoffice convert report.md --to pdf               # md/html/docx/xlsx/pptx → pdf, pdf → docx/xlsx/pptx, …
genoffice create --type docx --from notes.md --out notes.docx
genoffice create --type xlsx --from table.json --out sales.xlsx   # "=SUM(B2:B9)" cells stay live formulas
genoffice docs read report.docx --range 0-9 --json # then `docs apply --ops edits.json` edits in place
genoffice render report.docx --out shots/          # one PNG per page, to look at what you made
genoffice open sales.xlsx                          # hand the result to the editor
```

Every command prints a one-line summary, or a single JSON object with
`--json`. Edits are atomic: a rejected op leaves the file untouched and comes
back with a guided error. `genoffice help` lists the current command surface;
the full reference is [packages/cli/README.md](packages/cli/README.md).

### What the agent actually runs

The Solar System deck in the [demo](#demo) took one prompt in Claude Code.
Behind it, the agent followed the skill's staged workflow and the CLI checked
every stage before the next one started:

```bash
genoffice capabilities --json                        # which cloud tools GenOffice has configured
genoffice guide slides design                        # the deck workflow and layout library
genoffice image "the eight planets in a row …" --aspect 16:9 --out deck/assets/cover.jpg
genoffice slides check deck/outline.json --json      # 8 pages, no findings
genoffice slides check deck/pages/01.json --json     # builds one slide, audits overflow and overlap
…                                                    # one page file per slide, fixed until each check is clean
genoffice create --type pptx --spec deck/pages --outline deck/outline.json --out deck/solar-system.pptx --json
genoffice slides render deck/solar-system.pptx --out deck/shots --json
genoffice slides audit deck/solar-system.pptx --json    # 8 slides, no layout issues
genoffice slides replace deck/solar-system.pptx --slide 4 --spec deck/pages/05.json --json
genoffice open deck/solar-system.pptx
```

No model call happens inside `genoffice`: the agent does the thinking, the CLI
does the building and the checking, and the result opens in GenOffice or
PowerPoint as an ordinary `.pptx`.

### MCP server

The same commands are available as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
tools, for assistants that cannot run a terminal or that you would rather not
give one. There are two ways in, both shown with copy-ready snippets in
**Settings → Integrations → MCP**:

| Way                                   | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A · `genoffice mcp`** (recommended) | A stdio server the assistant starts itself; GenOffice does not need to be open. One tool per command (`info`, `convert`, `create_docx`, `create_xlsx`, `create_pptx`, `create_pdf`, `docs_read` / `docs_apply` / `docs_check`, `sheet_*`, `slides_*`, `render`, `guide`, `search`, `image`, `media`, `open`) plus the staged deck flow `deck_start` → `deck_page` → `deck_build` → `deck_replace`. Ops, specs and Markdown are passed inline, so a client without a file system still works. |
| **B · Local HTTP server**             | Runs inside the GenOffice app on `http://127.0.0.1:3093/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, with legacy SSE). Its tools drive a visible Word editor tab: `create_session`, `insert_content`, `replace_blocks`, `apply_ops`, `read_document`, `save_session`, and you watch the document take shape. Off by default; switch it on in the same settings pane.                                                                                                                                               |
| **C · `genoffice mcp --http`**        | The stdio tool set as a Streamable HTTP server for clients on other machines: a container, a sandbox, a shared box on your network. Files travel with the calls: `PUT /files/<name>` uploads one and returns a URL, every `file` parameter takes an http(s) URL, and a tool that writes a file hands it back as a download URL plus, when small, the bytes as an MCP resource. `--host 0.0.0.0` opens it to the network, `--token` protects it.                                              |

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport stdio genoffice -- genoffice mcp
```

```jsonc
// Cursor, Claude Desktop or any other MCP client
{ "mcpServers": { "genoffice": { "command": "genoffice", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

```bash
# On the machine that has GenOffice (private network; add --token for a shared box)
genoffice mcp --http 3093 --host 0.0.0.0 --token "$GENOFFICE_MCP_TOKEN"

# From the client: upload, then use the URL wherever a tool takes a file
curl -T report.docx -H "Authorization: Bearer $GENOFFICE_MCP_TOKEN" http://server:3093/files/
#   → { "url": "http://server:3093/files/<id>/report.docx", ... }
#   docs_read({ "file": "http://server:3093/files/<id>/report.docx" })
#   docs_apply(...) → output_url, downloadable with curl -o
```

Over HTTP every session gets a private scratch folder, relative paths and deck
folders resolve inside it, `open` is not offered, and with
`GENOFFICE_ALLOWED_ROOTS` unset the tools cannot leave the server's own file
store. `render`, `convert` to PDF and `create_pdf` still start a hidden
GenOffice process, so a headless host needs the app installed and a virtual
display (`xvfb-run`).

`genoffice` here is the CLI shipped inside the app (on macOS
`/Applications/GenOffice.app/Contents/Resources/cli/genoffice`; the settings
pane prints the exact path for your install). The server carries its own
workflow instructions and exposes the op references as `genoffice://guide/*`
resources, so no skill is needed; the skill and the MCP server can coexist and
the assistant picks one. Cloud features (`search`, `image`, `media`) still go
through the provider configured in GenOffice; everything else runs locally, and
`GENOFFICE_ALLOWED_ROOTS` confines every tool to the folders you list.

The renewable-energy deck in the [demo](#demo) is what one prompt in Claude Code
with only the `genoffice` MCP server attached looks like from the protocol
side:

```text
capabilities · guide(slides, spec) · guide(slides, design)
search(query) ×4                         → IEA, BNEF and IRENA figures for the slides
search(query, images) ×7 · media(url, ask) ×7
                                         → candidate photos, each one checked to be a real photograph
deck_start(dir, style, outline)          → outline checked: 8 pages to write
deck_page(dir, 0, page) … deck_page(dir, 7, page)
                                         → each page checked against the outline and the palette; one page sent again
deck_build(dir, out)                     → renewables-2026.pptx, no image failures
slides_audit(file) · slides_render(file, out)
                                         → no layout findings; 8 PNGs come back as image content
deck_replace(dir, n, page) ×3 · slides_render(file, out)
                                         → three pages fixed after looking at the renders
```

Thirty-eight calls, about thirteen minutes, and the assistant never touched a
shell: the figures, the photos, the guides, the checks and the renders all
travelled as MCP tool results. Only `search` and `media` left the machine, to
the provider configured in GenOffice.

<details>
<summary><b>Installing on Linux</b></summary>

The deb installs with apt — it pulls in the dependencies and adds GenOffice
to the applications menu:

```bash
sudo apt install ./genoffice_<version>_amd64.deb
```

On Fedora / RHEL-family / openSUSE, install the rpm instead:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./genoffice-<version>.x86_64.rpm     # Fedora / RHEL family
sudo zypper install ./genoffice-<version>.x86_64.rpm  # openSUSE
```

The AppImage runs in place: install the FUSE 2 runtime
(`sudo apt install libfuse2`; on Ubuntu 24.04 the package is `libfuse2t64`),
make the file executable, then run it:

```bash
chmod +x GenOffice-<version>.AppImage
./GenOffice-<version>.AppImage
```

</details>

## How it works

Seven Electron apps — Docs, Sheets, Slides, PDF, Markdown, HTML and the
tabbed shell — share one engine layer of pure TypeScript packages plus a Rust
sidecar for `.xlsx`. The original file is always the source of truth: edits
are applied as narrow patches, and everything the editor did not touch
survives the round trip untouched.

```
open docx ─► archive original by hash (never touched)
          ─► parse word/document.xml into a block tree, each block anchored to its original XML
          ─► Tiptap editor (manual + AI editing, dirty tracking)
save      ─► dirty blocks → OOXML fragments (referencing existing styles only)
          ─► splice into the original document.xml; untouched blocks keep their bytes
          ─► repack the zip; every other entry is copied byte-for-byte
```

The package-by-package tour (docx/pptx engines, `pdf2docx`, `html2docx`, the
agent core and providers) lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#engine-packages).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run fixtures     # generate test .docx fixtures
npm test             # engine + app unit tests (docs/sheets/slides need no display)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across every workspace
npm run dev          # all six editors + shell against Vite dev servers
npm run dev:docs     # a single app (same pattern works per workspace)
npm run dist:mac     # package macOS dmg (regenerates third-party notices)
npm run dist:win     # package Windows nsis installer
npm run dist:linux   # package Linux AppImage + deb + rpm
```

The sheets app additionally needs a Rust toolchain for its xlsx sidecar
(`cargo` on PATH); `npm run build -w @genoffice/sheets` compiles it
automatically. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the checks every
change must pass and how pull requests land.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is GenOffice free?</b></summary>

Yes. GenOffice is free and open-source under the Apache-2.0 license — no
trial, no paid tier for the apps themselves.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice open Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files?</b></summary>

Yes. GenOffice opens and saves native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx` files.
Saving is byte-preserving: parts of the file you didn't touch are written
back byte-for-byte, so documents keep working in Microsoft Office.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does GenOffice work offline?</b></summary>

Document editing is fully local — files never leave your machine to be
opened, edited, saved or converted. The AI features (agents, search, image
tools) need a network connection, with either a Genspark sign-in or your own
model API key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice edit PDF files?</b></summary>

Yes — real PDF text and image editing that rewrites the page content stream
with the original fonts preserved, not cover-up annotations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice convert PDF to Word, Excel or PowerPoint?</b></summary>

Yes — entirely on-device: PDFium character-level extraction plus
geometry-based layout analysis, no cloud service, no upload. Scanned pages
are covered too: on macOS and Windows the system OCR reads them, so they
convert to editable text rather than a page image.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use my own AI model or API key?</b></summary>

Yes. Besides the keyless Genspark sign-in, GenOffice supports bring your own
key for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax,
Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty, Opper and OpenCode Zen/Go, plus any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint — including local model servers. Search, image generation and
image/video analysis take their own keys under Settings → AI Media & Search.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice convert HTML to Word?</b></summary>

Yes — Export as Word in the HTML app produces a native, editable `.docx`
entirely on-device. The page is rendered in the built-in Chromium and reduced
to real Word structures: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, cards, KPI rows,
form fields and page backgrounds; only visuals with no Word counterpart
(charts, icons, decorated boxes) are embedded as pictures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I drive GenOffice from Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or a script?</b></summary>

Yes. GenOffice installs a `genoffice` command line that runs the same engines
headless: inspect, convert, create, read and edit documents from a terminal or
a script, with `--json` output for programs. The bundled agent skill teaches
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode and Windsurf
to use it; install it from **Settings → Integrations**. See
[Command line and agent skill](#command-line-and-agent-skill).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does GenOffice collect any data?</b></summary>

Official packaged builds send limited usage analytics by default, and you can
disable reporting at any time under Settings → General. Analytics never sends
document content, file names, file paths, account identity or email
addresses. See [GenOffice Privacy](PRIVACY.md) for the complete event and
data disclosures.
