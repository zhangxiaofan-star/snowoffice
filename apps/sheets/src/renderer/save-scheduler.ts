/**
 * Shared gate for the two periodic workbook savers in App.tsx: the AutoSave
 * tick ('save', every 30s and on window blur) and the crash-recovery copy
 * tick ('recovery', every 30s). They used to carry independent in-flight
 * flags, so with AutoSave on, a dirty workbook could start BOTH saves
 * concurrently; in the main process the first finisher tears the workbook
 * session down while the second is still reading, and the survivor reports
 * "Unknown workbook session." (save failed) although the file was written.
 * One gate: at most one save at a time. With AutoSave on, its real save
 * flushes the journal so the recovery tick no-ops; with AutoSave off, the
 * 30s crash-recovery guarantee is unchanged. Pure so it can be unit tested.
