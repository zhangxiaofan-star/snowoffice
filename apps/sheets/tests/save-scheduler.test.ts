/**
 * Regression: the AutoSave tick ('save') and the crash-recovery copy tick
 * ('recovery') each carried their own in-flight flag, so with AutoSave on a
 * dirty workbook started both saves concurrently every 30 s. In the main
 * process the first finisher tears the workbook session down while the second
 * is still reading; the survivor reported "Unknown workbook session."
 * (save failed) although the file had been written. Both ticks now share one
 * gate (save-scheduler.ts / saveInFlightRef), so a second tick skips instead
 * of racing, and retries on its next 30 s wake-up.
