 * A `ReadableStream` over bytes already in memory, fed one slice at a time.

 * in this package used it, but `Blob.prototype.stream` is not everywhere: jsdom
 * — the environment the Docs, Slides, PDF, Markdown and HTML app tests run in —
 * ships a `Blob` without it (its `ReadableStream` is Node's, so streams
 * themselves are fine). #798 is the metafile side of that, #781 the zip-gate
 * side, where it failed 389 `apps/docs` tests.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Node builtins: both callers reach the renderer bundle,
 * where `node:*` imports fail the build on Vite's browser-external stubs.
